What is the fantasy internet??
==============================

The fantasy internet is a reinvention and reimagining of the web. It is the cyberspace we used to dream of, but never came to pass.

What would the internet look like, had it been introduced on the good ol' microcomputers of the 80'ies..?

What if you could get on the net from an arcade machine and play games with anyone in the world?

Why doesn't the internet look like it does in the movies??

Let's start over and make cyberspace the way it was supposed to be!
